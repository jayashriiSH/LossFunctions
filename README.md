# LossFunctions
# ML Loss Functions â€“ Regression & Classification

This project explains and visualizes different **loss functions** used in both regression and classification tasks. It includes math formulas, simple explanations, and graphs to help understand how each loss behaves.

###  Regression Losses (on House Price Prediction dataset)
1. **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**
2. **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
3. **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
4. **Relative Error**
5. **Huber Loss**
- Math formula
-  Plots for **MSE**, **MAE**, and **Huber**
-  Used real prediction errors from a trained model

---

###  Classification Losses (on custom simple datasets)
1. **Binary Cross Entropy**
2. **Cross Entropy for Multiple Classes**
3. **KL Divergence**
4. **Hinge Loss**

-  Each with simple math and explanation
-  Plotted on small custom examples for clear understanding

## 
-  graphs showing how each loss reacts to prediction error  
- Examples for both regression and classification
## Goal

To build a basic understanding of how different loss functions work, and when to use them.
